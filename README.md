# Description: 
    The original Spotify is an online Music Application with multiple features for artists and listeners. 
    
    Spotify provides a premium music service with high-quality audio, custom playlists, recommendations, and an enormous music database. 
    
    Spotify admits artists post their music on this platform. 

Our project is Spotify Clone, and we attempt to step by step recreate the famous web app on our own. For the purpose of this course, we focus mainly on the core functionalities and database manipulation and hope to learn more in the process.
